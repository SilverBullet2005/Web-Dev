            or idea.<strong> Though not required </strong> by the orthographic conventions of any language with a 
            writing system, paragraphs are a conventional means of organizing extended segments of prose.

        <p>Very-large-scale integration is the process of creating an integrated circuit
            by combining millions or billions of <abbr title = "Metal Oxide Semiconductor">MOSFET</abbr> transistors onto a single chip.
            VLSI began in the 1970s when MOS integrated circuit chips were developed and then widely adopted, 
            enabling complex semiconductor and telecommunication technologies.</p>
